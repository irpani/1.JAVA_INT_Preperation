	/*
	 * Q: What is a Program? A:It's nothing but a set of Instructions used to
	 * control the behaviour of a machine
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Programming Languages: ---------------------- Programming Language, is an
	 * Artificial Language Design Instructions to Communicate to a Machine
	 * particularly a Computer There are many Programming languages as per latest
	 * Data Among them java is one of the most Powerful language that is being used
	 * 
	 * for Coding Programming language used to create Programs that control the
	 * behaviour of a machine It could be Computer (or) Rocket (or) smart Tv
	 * 
	 */

	/*
	 * Q:Programming LANGUAGES are Devided into 2 Types A: Lowlevel & Highlevel
	 * Lowlevel : It is a language that machine understands and of 2 Types Assembly
	 * & Machine language
	 * 
	 * 1.Machine Language is the language which is directly run on CPU which are
	 * Serice of bits like 0's and 1's reprasenting the Computer Can underdatnd This
	 * is tedious & error prone to write code manually Not portable Specific to
	 * particular type machine only ultimately all languages need to be translated
	 * to machine language
	 * 
	 * Commands: 0'S 1'S
	 * 
	 * 2.Assembly language whichnuage Using this we get less error prone Coding
	 * easier than machine It replaces 0's and 1's with Mnemonics Codes for
	 * Corresponding machine language
	 *
	 * It's has Commands Like move
	 * 
	 * jmp
	 * 
	 * CMP
	 * 
	 * ADD
	 *

	/**
	 * Higher level Languages: These are more userfriendly and closer to human
	 * language ,They are of 2 types (1).Procudural (2).Object Oriented
	 * 
	 * Which are portable English like languages making convinience to use JAVA C#
	 * PYTHON and so on ....
	 * 
	 * Amount of Abstarction provided define level of Progrmming languages
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Difference between Procedural and Object oriened ? Procedural : 1) program is
	 * written as Sequece of instructions to solve the problems Ex: Recipies Morning
	 * Activities sequence After wakeup 2).It is top down Approch 3).Data is not
	 * secure 4).Code is interdependent 5).Reuse is Difficult 6).Compiler =>
	 * translates highlevel language into machine language generate executable code
	 * like .exe
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Object Oriented 1).is an interaction of functions between objets
	 * 
	 * 2).It is bottom to top Approch with more focus on Functions 3).Helps wrap the
	 * Data with functions in a class is Secure 4).Code is modular 5).Provide more
	 * Security 6).Interpreter => Translates high level Instructions into an
	 * intermedite Code Each and every line executed individually
