	/**
	 * 
	 * When we Writing Some Code Suppose 1000 lines Of code Inside method from 1000
	 * Lines Of Code first 900 lines Of code exected Successfully now 901 to 905
	 * lines these 5 lines giving some problem If Some problem Occured in your Code
	 * the Controlled will be trasfer to JVM ,then JVM will analyse the Problem and
	 * it will create some exception related Object It will throw that object in
	 * your Program If u are not handling that Object what will happened?,JVM will
	 * propagate the object to the default Exception Handler Default Exception
	 * Handler will print the error message and your program will be terminated
	 * means here Abnormal Termination Happened
	 * 
	 * 
	 * What is My Requirement because Of these 5 lines of Code I don't want to
	 * terminate entire Program for these 5 lines of code I can use try Catch block
	 * these 5 lines give problem these 5 lines should not execute remainig 100
	 * lines should execute In this scenarion we will use Exeception handler
	 *
