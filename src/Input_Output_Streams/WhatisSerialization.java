	/****
	 * Q: What is Serialization ? A:Serializatin means It is the process of writing
	 * State of an object to the File For Example ,Supppose 2 Java Application U
	 * have 1 Applcation is Installed in 1 Machine Anothere Application insalled on
	 * Second Machine I want to Invoke the functionality Of the Application which is
	 * running in Remote Machine from 1 Machine I want to Communicate or I want to
	 * worked On Another Machine so when u are Invoking the Fucntionality of Remote
	 * Machine there is Chance to u have to pass some Data So this is Primitive type
	 * Data can pass Directly Value that VALUE U can use ,but Some times u will get
	 * the Requirement to pass the Object as Parameter ,Object as Data foR
	 * cOMMUNIATION, So when u are passing Object Reference Variable in 1 Machine to
	 * another Machine from 1 App to another Applicatin then ref var Contains the
	 * Address Of an Object for passing the address Of an Object from 1 Mchint to
	 * another Machine we cannt access the Data there because Suppose 1 Machine is
	 * your windows another machine is linux Windows u have .exe System linux have
	 * another File System they Cann't Communicated So when ever we have requirement
	 * to send the Object from 1 machine to another machine 1 Application to another
	 * Application then using Serialization u write the Data Of Object in to file
	 * over the Network then we go for Serialization
	 * 
	 * Serialization:- --------------- Serialization is the Process Of Saving State
	 * of an Object to the File
	 * 
	 * Deserialization -------------- And using Deserialization again u typecast
	 * again u convert that file into Object and use the Data
	 *
